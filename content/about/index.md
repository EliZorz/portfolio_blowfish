Eli was just a little girl when Granny commissioned her the first pastels painting to hang in the living room, a copy of the wonderful Japanese Footbridge by Claude Monet... 
And now, as an environment artist based in Northern Italy, Eli is still dedicated to render the beauty of natural sceneries. 

Her digital journey started in 2019 with Krita and Clip Studio Paint, then she approached Procreate, SketchUp and, more recently, Blender. 

As of now, art is a side quest in her life: although it isn't her primary focus right now due to her engineering career, she sees potential in merging her passion for art with a professional path. Even though she doesn't have any previous experience (yet) in the animation or videogame industry, Eli would love to build a career with a background and visual development focus, in a team of peers with the same enthusiasm and creativity!

**Have a nice day!**
