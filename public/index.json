While it may seem strange to have a failed attempt image in a portfolio, I think it is important to acknowledge the growth that came from development mistakes.

I decided to go for the fourth thumbnail, for the more gentle illumination and message: spring, to me, is also the feeling of starting to wake up again after a long winter season.\rThe main mistake in my previous process was to not gather up references for my background. I feel in my comfort zone when painting forests, so I went for that (also because the collaboration deadline was slowly approaching).\nMoodboard created to gather ideas after first failed attempt.\rStep-by-Step: building up the painting. I started with the background (mostly inspired by Unknown author\u0026rsquo;s reference in my moodboard. Then I included the stump, but I kept thinking about the supernatural interacting with the natural\u0026hellip; After some research, I finally thought of adding a fox to represent the wild essence of life, curiously exploring a Jizo statue, which in some Eastern cultures is often associated with protection of children and the souls in the afterlife, hence symbolizing the guardianship and nurturing aspect of life.\rFinal composition.\rHost (IG accounts):\nimpori_\tyancantdraw zeidsalfitiart Collaborators (IG accounts):\nkyanneoss\tb92634 drawing_with_mussy hollyillust._ kkaterinakan hoshioyo cdav.isart hiazalya marilookformarie silkydags fernforrest_ katmkart mildly.moldy mibo._d nizze01 guillyliaa baovihnim coraff7f50 ethvarra alisartjourney_ strawberry.creamcheese alleclerr kyuminq cafecat_idk lymeyoff aaeliu die_inthesea toffees_studio kalu_kadu optimalcolibri1 booaue_\r","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/blossominglife/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"üíÆ Blossoming Life üíÆ","type":"projects"},{"content":"Eli was just a little girl when Granny commissioned her the first pastels painting to hang in the living room, a copy of the wonderful Japanese Footbridge by Claude Monet\u0026hellip; And now, as an environment artist based in Northern Italy, Eli is still dedicated to render the beauty of natural sceneries.\nHer digital journey started in 2019 with Krita and Clip Studio Paint, then she approached Procreate, SketchUp and, more recently, Blender.\nAs of now, art is a side quest in her life: although it isn\u0026rsquo;t her primary focus right now due to her engineering career, she sees potential in merging her passion for art with a professional path.
